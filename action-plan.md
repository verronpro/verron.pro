## Week 1: Foundation & First Impression (Days 1–7)

**Objective:** Remove all technical barriers, make the site crawlable, and create a credible, professional-first impression.

### 🛠️ Technical SEO
- [x] **Create and upload `robots.txt`** (allow all, point to sitemap).
- [x] **Generate a full `sitemap.xml`** (all important pages) and submit it to **Google Search Console** and **Bing Webmaster Tools**.
- [x] **Register both properties in Google Search Console:** `verron.pro` and `office-stamper.verron.pro` (to track cross-domain data).
- [x] **Verify SSL/HTTPS** is enforced; fix any mixed-content warnings (use a free crawler like Screaming Frog).
- [ ] **Check Core Web Vitals** via PageSpeed Insights; optimize images if needed.

### 🛠️✍️ Site Structure & Navigation
- [x] **Update `/archive/` page** on verron.pro to list all posts chronologically with titles and excerpts.
- [x] **Add a global navigation menu** to every page with: Home, Blog, Projects, About, Contact.
- [x] **Ensure an RSS feed** (`/feed.xml`) is available and linked from the blog page.
- [x] **Add a simple search functionality** or, at minimum, tag/category filtering on the blog index.

### ✍️ Content Optimization (Quick Wins)
- [x] **Write unique meta descriptions** for the top 5 most important posts and for the About page.
- [x] **Add alt text** to all images and code screenshots in those posts.
- [x] **Implement `rel=canonical` tags** on all pages to self-reference, protecting against future duplicate content.

### 🧑‍💻 Professional Image – About Page Overhaul
- [x] **Add a professional headshot.**
- [x] **Clearly state your title and role:** “IT Manager & CISO in the energy sector in China.”
- [x] **Add a `Trust & Proof` section:**
    - GitHub star/forks/download statistics for office-stamper (using shields.io badges).
    - 1–2 short user testimonials or quotes from resolved issues.
    - Links to any certifications, publications, or past speaking engagements.
- [x] **Write a Professional Philosophy sentence** that ties together “Caring Coder,” security, and AI.
- [x] **Update your LinkedIn headline** to: “Caring Coder | CISO | Crafting Enterprise Java & Secure AI Document Solutions.” Pin a post linking to the new About page.

### 📦 Office-Stamper Integration (Week 1)
- [x] **Revamp the `README.md` of `office-stamper`:**
    - Add an “Author” section with your bio and a clear link to the blog.
    - Create a “Who Uses This?” section (ask one user for permission, or list “Used in energy sector document automation”).
    - Add contextual links to relevant blog posts (e.g., after the Quick Start: “*Read the architectural deep dive on the blog*”).
- [x] **Add a global navigation bar to `verron.pro`** that includes a **“Projects”** page. This page should feature `office-stamper` with a summary and links to docs, source, and blog posts.

## Week 2: Content Crown Jewels & AI Positioning (Days 8–14)

**Objective:** Optimize existing expert content for search and launch the core thought leadership pieces that bridge Java craftsmanship with AI.

### ✍️ Content SEO – Topical Authority
- [ ] **Choose the top 3–5 existing posts.** For each:
    - Rewrite the `<title>` tag to include a primary long-tail keyword (e.g., "Java Docx Generation with office-stamper").
    - Align H1 closely with the title.
    - Use H2 headings to include secondary keywords naturally.
    - Add 2–3 internal links to other related posts using descriptive anchor text.
- [ ] **Perform keyword research** (free tools: Google autocomplete, “People Also Ask”, Ahrefs Webmaster Tools) to identify 5–10 long-tail queries around “java docx library”, “apache poi alternative”, “llm generate word document”, “secure document automation”. Map each to an existing or planned post.

### ✍️🏗️ Pillar Content & Manifesto
- [ ] **Write and publish the AI crossover pillar post:** *“Can an LLM Generate a Perfect .docx? Not Yet – Here’s How I’m Bridging the Gap.”*
    - Include a mini-demo: prompt → JSON → office-stamper → validated .docx.
    - Embed a short (2‑min) screen recording or annotated screenshots.
- [ ] **Write and publish the Caring Coder manifesto:** *“Why I’ll Keep Caring About Document Generation in the Age of AI.”*
    - Articulate your credible, security-aware stance on AI.
    - Cross-post a summary on LinkedIn to spark discussion.

### 📦 Office-Stamper Integration (Week 2)
- [ ] **In the new pillar post, link deeply to relevant pages on the `office-stamper.verron.pro` documentation.**
- [ ] **On the documentation site**, add a sidebar or footer to every page: “*Handcrafted with care by Joseph Verron. Read the stories behind the code on verron.pro.*”

## Week 3: Off-Site Visibility & Link Building (Days 15–21)

**Objective:** Build real backlinks and become recognized in niche communities (Java, AI, security).

### 📣 Community Engagement
- [ ] **Stack Overflow:** Find 3 unanswered questions on generating .docx with Java, Apache POI `split run` issues, or strict schema compliance. Provide a concise, expert answer and, where appropriate, link to your deeper blog post for context.
- [ ] **Reddit:** Join r/java, r/programming, r/LocalLLaMA. Share a short, value-first case study: “How I used my lib to generate a schema-compliant contract from an LLM prompt.” Link back only if genuinely relevant.
- [ ] **Awesome Lists:** Submit a PR to include `office-stamper` in `awesome-java`, `awesome-generative-ai`, or similar curated lists.

### 📣 Guest Content & Syndication
- [ ] **Write a guest post pitch** for DZone, The New Stack, or InfoQ on “Secure Document Automation in the Age of LLMs: A CISO’s View.” Include your unique angle and credentials.
- [ ] **Cross-post the AI pillar article** to a relevant Medium publication (e.g., *Better Programming*, *Towards Data Science*) with a `rel=canonical` tag pointing back to verron.pro.

### 📦 Office-Stamper Integration (Week 3)
- [ ] **Add a “Documented with Care at verron.pro” badge** to the office-stamper README.
- [ ] **Create a simple “Walking Skeleton” demo** (a static `demo.html` under GitHub Pages) that visualizes “Prompt in → .docx out.” Embed a link to your pillar blog post for the full explanation.

## Week 4: Amplification & Set Up for Scale (Days 22–28)

**Objective:** Create a persistent signal of activity, capture emails, and start tracking growth.

### 📣 Content Amplification
- [ ] **Create a downloadable asset:** Turn the “Secure AI Document Generation Checklist” (10‑point) into a PDF. **Gate it behind a simple email signup** (using ConvertKit, Mailchimp free tier, or similar). Publish a landing page for it on verron.pro.
- [ ] **Record a 3‑minute video** showing the LLM → .docx pipeline in action. Publish natively on LinkedIn, YouTube, and embed in the pillar post.
- [ ] **Send the checklist and video to relevant newsletters** (e.g., Java Weekly, AI Engineer digest) as a resource worth sharing.

### 🛠️ Analytics & Monitoring
- [ ] **Set up Google Analytics (GA4)** if not already done, and connect it to Search Console.
- [ ] **Create a simple dashboard** or recurring report to track: clicks, impressions, average position for priority keywords (especially around AI + doc generation).
- [ ] **Schedule a weekly 30‑min “caring maintenance” slot** to review performance, update one old post, and engage on social platforms.

### 📦 Office-Stamper Integration (Week 4)
- [ ] **Ensure the “Projects” page on verron.pro is live** and presents `office-stamper` in a visually engaging way that appeals even to non-developers (future employers). Use a simple diagram to show the problem and solution.
- [ ] **Double-check cross-domain tracking:** In Search Console, verify you can see traffic flows between the two domains. Add any necessary cross-linking annotations.

### 🧑‍💻 Ongoing Professional Touch
- [ ] **Send thank-you notes** to collaborators, testimonial providers, or anyone who shared your content. Nurture those relationships.
- [ ] **Write a short internal retrospective** (just for yourself) summarizing which actions moved the needle and what to double down on next month.
